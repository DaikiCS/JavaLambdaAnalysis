# Project Name: 
Java Lambda Analysis

# Tools:
1. Java
2. Python
3. MySQL
4. Octave
5. Eclipse

# About:
This is a project in Software Engineering class. 
The topic includes:

1. How often lambda expression is used?
2. In what case lambda expression is used?
3. How different Java lambda expression is from other languages?

I was in charge of the 1st topic and produced graphs to see the usage rate of lambda expression in open source projects.

# Instruction: 
This is not the complete package to run. The detailed is described in the power point slide contained in this repository. 

1. How to compile: 
2. How to execute: 
3. Expected output: Graph which shows the usage rate of lambda expression over years.
4. Known issues:  

# What I learned:
I learned about Java, MySQL, Eclipse, and overall project architecture to run. 
I also learned how to write a research paper.
