# Project Name: 
Java Lambda Analysis

# About:
This is a project that I did in Software Engineering class. It is a team project and we chose lambda expression to analyze in this project. My part is to investigate how often lambda expression is used in open-source projects.

# Instruction: 
This is not the complete package to run. The detailed is described in the power point slide contained in this repository. 

1. How to compile: 
2. How to execute: 
3. Expected output: Graph which shows the usage rate of lambda expression over years.
4. Known issues:  

# What I learned:
I learned about Java, MySQL, Eclipse, and overall project architecture to run. 
I also learned how to write a research paper.
